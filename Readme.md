## Overview
This project is submitted to forward school as part of the task and excersise for the introduction to Blockchain Technology class held in in the previous week.

### Project
FS Project 1: Building your own Blockchain

### Task
Hi guys, this is Jeremy, Team Lead here at Forward School. Once again I like to welcome you to the Bitcoin/Web3 developer 2023 Q1.

This is week II and you will be Building your own Blockchain. Yes! you heard it right. This is going to be your first project and you are expected to complete it before next week.

So just get ready to begin.

As we mentioned, Forward School is all about building rather than just consuming content and nodding your head. You build, not “thinking” you can build. So you will be doing a lot of guided research and development throughout this program.

Let’s Begin.

### Solution Approach
The approch method used in this project is to create a constructor to initialize a blockhain node and use prototype to create an object of new block on the existing node which contain new blocks and transactions

#### Aprroch content
The main idea for this project is to create a transaction block which can be used to transfer BTC to five different other blocks with proof of work

`Signature`
`Timestamp`
`Sender Wallet addres`
`Token Sent`
`Reciever Wallet address`
`Amount Sent `

#### Programming language adopted
`Javascrpt`

#### Access Endpoint
To access the result of all transaction 
use `npm start` 
the result can be viewed in the console
